 I'm Jintai Hong, a first-year graduate student in [Computer Science & Technology at Xiamen University](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/), focusing on software security testingâ€”specifically database testing and large model testing. 
 
 Guided by [Professor Wu Rongxin](https://wurongxin1987.github.io/wurongxin.xmu.edu.cn/) from [the System & Software Security Lab](https://s-cube-xmu.github.io/zh/), I'm passionate about exploring cutting-edge challenges in secure software validation. Feel free to browse my research, publications, and updates!"
